Purpose and Procedure

Thank you for taking part in this survey. We are studying how to help users understand intelligent algorithms that support people in making important decisions, such as whether a student should be admitted to college, whether a prisoner should be paroled, and whether a loan applicant should be given a loan. The survey should take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete.



Responses will be Confidential

All records from this study will be kept private. In addition, in any sort of report we might publish, we will not include any information that makes it possible to identify you. Research records will be stored securely, and only researchers will have access to the records.

 
 Contacts and Questions

This survey is being conducted by the GroupLens Research lab in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to contact the researchers at bowen-yu@umn.edu.
